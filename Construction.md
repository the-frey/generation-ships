# Construction

To make a board, we went to [Fred Aldous](http://www.fredaldous.co.uk) and bought an A1 sized mounting board. They offer a free cutting service, so we had it cut into 32, or to A6 size. 

The board itself is made up of twelve of these tiles and two starting tiles. You will need to number the twelve main tiles so that you can refer to their numbers with chance cards later.

In addition to numbers, your tiles will need: 

- Two asteroid field tiles (see image assets)
- One nebula tile (see image assets)
- Two planet tiles (see image assets)
- One crisis card token to place on the middle tile (we used an exotic coin)

Print the image assets on sticky-backed printer paper, then cut them out and apply to board tiles. The numbering isn't very important, as tiles are drawn at random from the box at the start of each game. 

## Tokens Needed

You will need at least ten resources per player. For starting out, toy tokens can be used (tiddlywinks counters, if you're in the UK), or simply use pennies or cents as these are readily available. For crew, you will need another ten counters per player, so either a different coin or red buttons should suffice.

## Dice Needed

You will also need some dice. For the water resources, we used a twelve-sided blue die per player. For Hull Integrity (hit points) we used a twenty-sided die. In addition, we had 2 red and 3 white dies for use during the game. 

## Ships

Have a pot of Lego to make your ships out of; we started with some stock Lego Star Wars mini ships, and then ended up also making some of our own. 

## Railguns

Make the railguns out of Lego as well... why not!

## Action Cards

If using the ruby script to generate these, then you don't need physical cards. However, we will be adding a PDF soon containing chance cards you can use by printing onto a standard rip-and-tear business card sheet that is freely available.
