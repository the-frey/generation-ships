## Crisis Cards

## The Turn

### On the half-way tile

- On the half-way tile, draw a crisis card.

### If on a regular tile:

- Take 1 point from your water store. 
- Draw a Action card. You may play one per turn.
- Trade with other players or buy a Action card for 3 Resources; you may decide the rate of exchange of resources between yourselves. 
- You may play a weapon, either a railgun or a Action card (*only* if no Action card has been played already). The target ship must be on the same tile or the tile behind.
- You may play a boarding card, but only if no Action card has been played already.
- You may exchange 2 Resource points for 1 Hull Integrity point.

### If on an asteroid tile:

- Take 1 point from your water store as normal
- Roll a red die and deduct that number of points from Hull Integrity. 
- There can be no trading while in the field.
- Action cards may be played that do not involve inter-ship communication.
- No boarding actions are possible.
- No repairs are possible.

### If on a planetary body tile:

- Play your turn as normal

OR: 

- Try and extract resources:
  - Nominate a resource or Hull Integrity, and replenish 2 points for every turn you stay in orbit.
  - Roll two dice; if you roll a 7, then draw a Crisis card. 
  - You may board or repair on this tile as normal.
  - Skip the movement phase of your turn as you are attempting to extract resources.

### Moving

- Once all trading has completed and cards have been played, move your ship forward one tile. 

### Boarding

- If you have a boarding card, you may board another ship. This will cost you four crew points if it is unsuccessful. If you are successful, you eliminate that player and take all their resources.
- 

#### Risking Overload

- To move two tiles, roll a red die. If the number is 2-6, move your ship foward two tiles. If it is a 1, your reactor overloads and your ship is destroyed. 
- If a two-tile move means you miss an asteroid tile, you will still have to roll for asteroid damage at the beginning of your next turn.
